# Bubblegum - NFTs in Merkle Trees
Supports decompressing bubblegum NFTs into either Tokenkeg tokens or Token22 tokens. The benefit of decompressing a bubblegum 
NFT is that normal tokens can be moved into a custodial wallet and freely transferred without relying on RPC nodes to serve 
your NFT data from an off-chain database.
