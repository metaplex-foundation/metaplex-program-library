## Overview

`Bubblegum` is the Metaplex Protocol program for creating and interacting with compressed Metaplex NFTs.  Compressed NFTs are secured on-chain using Merkle trees.

With Bubblegum you can:
* Create a tree
* Delegate authority for a tree.
* Mint a compressed NFT to a tree.
* Verify/unverify creators
* Verify/unverify membership of an NFT to a Metaplex Verified Collection.
* Transfer ownership of an NFT.
* Delegate authority for an NFT.
* Burn an NFT.
* Redeem an NFT and decompress it into an uncompressed Metaplex NFT.

## Background

Compressed NFTs differ from uncompressed NFTs in where their state (metadata, owner, etc.) is stored.  For uncompressed NFTs, all state data is stored in on-chain accounts.  This tends to be expensive at scale.  Compressed NFTs save space by encoding the state data into a Merkle tree.  This means that the detailed account data is not stored on-chain, but in data stores managed by RPC providers.

Compressed NFTs are secured on-chain by the hashing of the state data when it is added to the Merkle tree.  The Merkle root is a hash that cryptographically secures the state data for all of the leaves (NFTs) contained in the tree.

In the unlikely scenario that all RPC providers were to lose their data stores, the off-chain state of compressed NFTs could be recovered by replaying transactions (provided that the given tree was started from the beginning).

Compressed NFTs can also be losslessly decompressed into uncompressed Metaplex NFTs.  Decompression will cost rent for the Metadata and Master Edition `token-metadata` program accounts that need to be created.

## Basic operation

### Creating and minting to a tree

Anyone can create a tree using `create_tree` and then they are the tree owner.  They can also delegate authority to another wallet.

### Merkle proofs

After an NFT is minted, for any operations that modify the NFT, Merkle proofs must be provided with the instruction to validate the Merkle tree changes.  Bubblegum is an Anchor program and makes use of the remaining accounts feature for this purpose.  Merkle proofs are added as remaining account `Pubkey`s that are 32-byte Keccak256 hash values that represent the nodes from the Merkle tree that are required to calculate a new Merkle root.

### Creator verification

Creators are specified in a creators array in the metadata passed into the `mint_v1` instruction.  All creators for which `verified` is set to true in the creators array at the time of mint must be a signer of the transaction or the mint will fail.  Beyond the signers specified in the `MintV1` Account validation structure, the `mint_v1` instruction uses remaining accounts to optionally look for additional signing creators.  This does not conflict with the Merkle proofs requirement because proofs are not required for minting.

Beyond verifying creators at the time of mint, there are `verify_creator` and `unverify_creator` instructions that can be used on existing Compressed NFTs.

### Collection verification

Note that there is no such thing as compressed Verified Collections.  Collections are still NFTs created in the realm of Metadata and Master Edition `token-metadata` accounts.  Also note that a collection cannot be set to verified at the time of minting.  Instead, there are instructions to `verify_collection` and `unverify_collection`, as well as a `set_and_verify_collection` instruction for the case where the collection was set during the mint.  All of these require either the true Collection Authority to be a a signer, or a delegated Collection Authority to be a signer along with providing a Collection Authority Record PDA.  See the Metaplex documentation on [`Certified Collections`](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/token-metadata/certified-collections) for more information on verifying collections.

### Transfer ownership, delegate authority, and burn an NFT.

Compressed NFTs support transferring ownership, delegating authority, and burning the NFT.  See the [Instructions](##Instructions) section below for details.

### Redeem an NFT and decompress it into an uncompressed Metaplex NFT

Redeeming an NFT removes the leaf from the Merkle tree and creates a voucher PDA account.  The voucher account can be sent to the `decompress_v1` instruction to decompress the NFT into an uncompressed Metaplex NFT.  As mentioned above this will cost rent for the Metadata and Master Edition `token-metadata` accounts that are created during the decompression process.  Note that after a compressed NFT is redeemed but before it is decompressed, the process can be reversed using `cancel_redeem`.  This puts the compressed NFT back into the Merkle tree.

## Accounts

### 📄 `tree_authority`

The `tree_authority` PDA account data stores information about a Merkle tree.  It is initialized by `create_tree` and is updated by all other Bubblegum instructions except for decompression.
The account data is represented by the [`TreeConfig`](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex-program-library/blob/master/bubblegum/program/src/state/mod.rs#L17) struct.

| Field                              | Offset | Size | Description
| ---------------------------------- | ------ | ---- | --
| &mdash;                            | 0      | 8    | Anchor account discriminator.
| `tree_creator`                     | 8      | 32   | `PubKey` of the creator/owner of the Merkle tree.
| `tree_delegate`                    | 40     | 32   | `PubKey` of the delegate authority of the tree.  Initially it is set to the `tree_creator`.
| `num_minted`                       | 72     | 8    | `u64` that keeps track of the number of NFTs minted into the tree.  This value is very important as it is used as a nonce ("number used once") value for leaf operations to ensure the Merkle tree leaves are unique.  The nonce is basically the tree-scoped unique ID of the asset.  In practice for each asset it is retrieved from off-chain data store.

### 📄 `voucher`

The `voucher` PDA account is used when a compressed NFT is redeemed and decompressed.  It is initialized by `redeem` and represented by the [`Voucher`](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex-program-library/blob/master/bubblegum/program/src/state/mod.rs#L36) struct, which includes a reference to the [`LeafSchema`](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex-program-library/blob/master/bubblegum/program/src/state/leaf_schema.rs#L45) struct.

| Field                             | Offset | Size | Description
| --------------------------------- | ------ | ---- | --
| &mdash;                           | 0      | 8    | Anchor account discriminator.
| `leaf_schema`                     | 8      | 32   | `PubKey` of the creator/owner of the Merkle tree.
| `index`                           | 40     | 32   | `PubKey` of the delegate authority of the tree.  Initially it is set to the `tree_creator`.
| `merkle_tree`                     | 72     | 32   | `PubKey` of the Merkle tree to which the leaf belonged before it was redeemed.
