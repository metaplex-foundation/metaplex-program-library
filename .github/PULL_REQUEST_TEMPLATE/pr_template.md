### Note
Pull Requests that make fundamental changes to the Metaplex standard are unlikely to be accepted without a discussion first. Please open a feature request issue instead to discuss your desired changes. We are working on a more formal process for proposing changes to the Metaplex standard.

It's much easier for us to read and review a PR that is small, linted, and contains only one material enhancement. If your PR is very large and encompasing many features consider breaking it up in to a few PRs so we can digest the information in each pr with more accuracy.
